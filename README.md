# Chennai-Water-Level-Prediction
Chennai Water Level Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms



Chennai also known as Madras is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The city is facing an acute water shortage now (June 2019). Chennai is entirely dependent on ground water resources to meet its water needs.

 There are four reservoirs in the city, namely, Red Hills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam, with a combined capacity of 11,057 mcft.
 These are the major sources of fresh water for the city.
Apart from the reservoirs, the other sources of fresh water water are desalination plants at Nemelli and Minjur; aquifers in Neyveli, Minjur and Panchetty; Cauvery water from Veeranam lake;


## Objective
The idea is to see if we can use this dataset to
1.	Visualize the water need / usage of the city
2.	Identify whether the water sources availability will be able to meet the needs till the subsequent monsoon?
3.	How bad is the current water crisis compared to previous years?
